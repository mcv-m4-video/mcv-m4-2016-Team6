{"name":"Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring","tagline":"M4 Team 6","body":"### Abstract\r\nThe goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video sequences\r\nprocessing, mainly for surveillance applications. We will focus on video sequences\r\nfrom outdoor scenarios, with the application of traffic monitoring in mind. A working prototype\r\nto segment cars from surveillance videos will be implemented through the project.\r\nThe prototype will be robust againts:\r\n* • Illumination changes in the video,\r\n* • Noise and degraded images (such as the resulting from low bitrate coding),\r\n* • Unwanted camera vibrations.\r\n\r\nThe paper with the project explanation and conclusions is available here: _link2paper_\r\n\r\nThe development of the whole system has been planned in 5 weeks, as presented in detail\r\nin next sections.\r\n\r\n### Block 1: Foreground Extraction and Optical Flow\r\nThe goals of this first block is to understand and familiarize with the programing framework\r\nused in this project. Furthermore, the datasets used in the project together with the\r\nevaluation metrics that measure the performance of the algorithms used in the project\r\nwill be implemented and preliminary tested.\r\nSome functions to open and write the video sequences provided by the\r\ndatasets ara developed. To familiarize with the ground-truth provided by the databases\r\nfunctions to evaluate the results by measuring the proposed evaluation metrics are crated.\r\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qj0cXmwm_TVwlnHSyQtm_PQfXCcxlXnZ3wmaR3vlzNo/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Block 2: Background estimation\r\nThe goal of this week is to model the background pixels of a video sequence using a simple\r\nstatistical model. Firstly, a single gaussian model per pixel will be used to model the\r\nbackground pixels. The statistical model will be used to preliminary classify foreground\r\npixels in the sequence. The simple model will be compared with more complex ones such\r\nas the Stauffer and Grimson (provided in the programming framework).\r\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yNvwNfPo-9mqI6dKUcYNCdAbrtpuFSmzSigla5rFnwc/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Block 3: Foreground segmentation\r\nThe goal for this block will be to implement a robust foreground segmentation algorithm.\r\nThe statistical model implemented in the previous week is the baseline which must be\r\nimproved during this week. Two basic strategies are to applied: hole filling and area\r\nfiltering. In addition, a strategy to remove the shadows of the cars can also improve the\r\nfinal performance.\r\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JlhSoiSlHZesawOfloyxVH8zj-4DDlbqbWWsluXjzd0/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Block 4: Video Stabilization\r\nSurveillance cameras are often placed on physical support that can vibrate because of\r\nweather conditions or nearby transportations. This camera jitering affects the video sequence,\r\nintroducing an motion on both foreground objects and background. As a result,\r\nanalysis algorithms that depend from the extraction and tracking of foreground object can\r\nbe contaminated by the camera motion. This module focuses in the estimation of such\r\ncamera motion and existing techniques to achieve a virtual stabilization of the camera.\r\n[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ep_CthNgTZLDjZ3hVDmaFhX_fzuRhaz44Ae1hs2_DVg/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Block 5: Region tracking\r\nThe goal of this assignment is the implementation of a tracking system to uniquely identify\r\nthe objects in the scene. This tracking will allow counting the amount of vehicles and\r\nobtain an approximate estimation of their speed.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
